My name is Madhav Menon and I am currently studying physics at the Technical University of Munich, Germany.

My git/repositories mainly consist of a variety of data science projects in areas I have interest in as well 
as to showcase different areas in computing I'm trying to develop.

I try to implement increasingly complex acceleration optimization algorithims as well as numerical approaches 
(Monte carlo methods/ Ising model .etc) to further improve my models. 

The pursuit in endeavoring in these projects are purely out of interest and as a means to further develop my 
intuition about both data science and the field of its application.
